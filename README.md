# 🧱 Brutalist Developer Portfolio — Alejandro Farias

This is my personal developer portfolio, built with a bold, minimalist brutalist design.  
It reflects my personality: direct, fast, and focused on delivering real-world results.

No fluff — just clean architecture, raw typography, and projects that speak for themselves.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

> *"The code is the design."*

This site isn't about flashy animations or glossy UI.  
It's about clarity, intention, and showcasing how I think and build.

If you're looking for someone who prioritizes function, performance, and developer empathy — let's talk.
